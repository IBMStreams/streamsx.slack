**Slack** is a cloud-based set of team collaboration tools used for real-time messaging, archiving and search. It is commonly used in corporate settings to bring communication between teams into one place.   With the new Slack toolkit, you can now use Slack as a hub for messages and alerts from Streams applications.

This can be useful for monitoring, for example, you could use it to inform admins or developers of metrics from a running Streams application, or update the results of analysis.

This article will demonstrate how to send messages to any Slack channel from Streams using the **streamsx.slack** toolkit and its `SendSlackMessage` operator.
